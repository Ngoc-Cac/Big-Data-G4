# Big-Data-G4: Sentiment Analysis on KFC reviews from Google Maps
This is a project on Sentiment Analysis using Big Data framework Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. For ease of deployment, we opt for a multi-container Docker application to install the necessary service: Hadoop, Spark, Python and Jupyter.\
The project aims to develop a classification model on general comments about the chain KFC. In order to train the model, we crawled reviews from KFC locations within Hồ Chí Minh city on Google Maps.
